serializer - allow a convertion of native data (integer, string, dict) into text/string

int srt tuple sict -> (serializer) -> text/string -> service/client

10 - in admin add the app models

11 - create in the app a new file called 'serializers' 
12 - in serializes.py create a serializer for each model:
        from rest_framework import serializers
        from .models import Post

        class PostSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                model = Post
                fields = '__all__'


        Serialization = Converting models into byte stream -> JSON
        Deserealization = Converting JSON into byte stream -> dict

13 - create the APIview/GenericAPIView in views.py
        queryset = the colletion of data that you`ll work with 
        serializer = the serializer you`ve created in serializers.py
        you can use mixins to create the basic methods (get, post, put, delete)

14 - create the permissions = in the app create permissions.py

15 - hyperlinks - a way to easily navigate in the API
        create it inside a serializer 
        example: author = serializers.HyperlinkedIdentityField(view_name = 'author')
        update the views.py

16 - if you want to get a json (localhost/data.json) file of the data in the page you can add in urls.py:
        from rest_framework.urlpatterns import format_suffix_patterns
        urlpatterns = format_suffix_patterns(urlpatterns)
